This is the Final Project for P5 AP Computer Science Principles.

## Game Logic
Tetrahedron is a 2D, top-down, shooter/platformer. It's geometry themed, so the sprites aren't that detailed. You control a grey square or "Polygon" that shoots bullets out of its attached barrel. You are tasked with killing a certain amount of enemies (triangle shaped Polygons controlled by AI) and simultaneously jumping and free-running across different obstacles. 

## Controls 
- Your mouse movement controls where your Polygon is looking.
- Your left-click button controls shooting. Holding it down causes you to auto fire. You never run out of ammo.
- All arrow keys (left, right, up, down) control your Polygon's movement. 

## Logic
- The game has 50 levels, each harder and harder to beat. This game is designed like Pac-Man or Donkey Kong. Only skilled players can beat it. 
- This game has a Score Counter, anytime you kill a Triangle Polygon, you are awarded 500 points. Anytime you beat a level, you are awarded 1000 points. 
- You have 3 lives, with achieving 100,000 points awarding you with an extra life.
